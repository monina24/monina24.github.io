            <p>The schema of the circuit. 1k resistors were used for the LED's as that was more than enough resistance for the calculated number of Ohm's, even if they made the LED's slightly dimmer because of the higher resistance.</p>

            <p>A 10k resistor was used for the button because a resistor is needed in order to not send a direct current to ground when the button is pressed, which could damage the Arduino. In my calculation, only a 25 Ohm resistor is needed but I used a 10k resistor as it work just as well.</p>
