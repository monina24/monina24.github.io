    	<h1> Final Project Idea</h1>
    	<img src= "finalsketch.jpeg" width="500">
    	<p>A medication reminder using some sort of sensor that can tell if you've taken your medicine off the sensor, meaning you've taken your medication for the day. It uses LED's to indicate if you've taken it or not. You can also set a time for a buzzer to go off to remind you if you have not taken it by a certain time. </p>

    	<h2>Tuesday, February 19th Update</h2>
    	<p>After familiaring myself with the parts in our Arduino kit and looking up several different beginnering Arduino projects, I modified my final project idea slightly so it matched the scope of my abilities and materials I had on hand.</p>
    	
    	<img src= "sketch1.jpeg" width="500">
    	<img src= "sketch2.jpeg" width="500">

    	<p>I decided to make a reminder for taking daily medicine. There will be seven LED's that correspond to a day of the week. There will be an LED screen that is programmed to keep track of a 24 hour cycle. For a specifcied time of the day, the LED of the corresponding day will turn on, signaling the user to take their medicine. Pushing the button will turn off the LED, letting them know they've taken their medicine.</p>
    	<p>If ten minutes have passed from the intial time, the LED will begin to blink and the buzzer will go off. This is meant to help get the user's attention to take their medication.</p>
    	<p>For now, I've designated one LED for each day of the week, though I could simplify this by only using one LED as a reminder. However, I like the idea of having one LED per day of the week as it helps the user keep track of their medication inttake. I hope to make the version with seven  LED's, but I will see if I need to make changes as I begin working on this project.</p>

    	<p>Using my Arduino parts, I rearranged my pieces to see how they can all be laid out on the breadboard with the pill box.</p>
    	<p>Some next steps and questions I have to begin the implementation of this project are</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>How can you program the LED to keep track of the time</li>
    		<li>How do you connect the Arduino to the LED screen</li>
    		<li>Can I just use one Arduino for this project or do I need two for the amount of pins needed for the screen and LEDs?</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>I hope to answer these questions so I can start working on the physical computing and programming of my project.s</p>
