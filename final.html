    	<p>A medicine alarm clock that reminds you to take your medicine and shows if youâ€™ve taken it or not for the day. Great for people with disabilities or the elderly!</p>

    	<h2>Preparation</h2>

    	<h3>Original Concept</h3>
    	<img src= "finalsketch.jpeg" width="500">
    	<p>A medication reminder using some sort of sensor that can tell if you've taken your medicine off the sensor, meaning you've taken your medication for the day. It uses LED's to indicate if you've taken it or not. You can also set a time for a buzzer to go off to remind you if you have not taken it by a certain time. </p>

    	<h3>Ideas</h2>
    	<p>After familiaring myself with the parts in our Arduino kit and looking up several different beginnering Arduino projects, I modified my final project idea slightly so it matched the scope of my abilities and materials I had on hand.</p>
    	
    	<img src= "sketch1.jpeg" width="500">
    	<img src= "sketch2.jpeg" width="500">

    	<p>I decided to make a reminder for taking daily medicine. There will be seven LED's that correspond to a day of the week. There will be an LED screen that is programmed to keep track of a 24 hour cycle. For a specifcied time of the day, the LED of the corresponding day will turn on, signaling the user to take their medicine. Pushing the button will turn off the LED, letting them know they've taken their medicine.</p>
    	
    	<p>If ten minutes have passed from the intial time, the LED will begin to blink and the buzzer will go off. This is meant to help get the user's attention to take their medication.</p>
    	
    	<p>For now, I've designated one LED for each day of the week, though I could simplify this by only using one LED as a reminder. However, I like the idea of having one LED per day of the week as it helps the user keep track of their medication inttake. I hope to make the version with seven  LED's, but I will see if I need to make changes as I begin working on this project.</p>

    	<img src= "finalpic2.jpeg" width="500">
    	
    	<p>Using my Arduino parts, I rearranged my pieces to see how they can all be laid out on the breadboard with the pill box.</p>
    	
    	<p>Some next steps and questions I have to begin the implementation of this project are:</p>
    	
    	<ul>
    		<li>How can you program the LED to keep track of the time</li>
    		<li>How do you connect the Arduino to the LED screen</li>
    		<li>Can I just use one Arduino for this project or do I need two for the amount of pins needed for the screen and LEDs?</li>
    	</ul>
    	
    	<p>I hope to answer these questions so I can start working on the physical computing and programming of my project.</p>

        <h2>Final Version</h2>
        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>For the final version of this project, the Med-Minder is an alarm clock for daily medicine taking. There are two LED's, one green and one red, that lets the user know if they have taken their medicine for the day or not. The LED's automatically reset at the end of the day.</p>
        <p>The Arduino keeps track of the time, updating it on the LCD screen. The LCD screen also lets you know if you've taken you medicine for the day with different messages.</p>
        <p>When the alarm goes off at the pre-set time, the LCD screen changes to remind the user to take their meds. The buzzer goes off as well as the LED strip around the box, which blinks to get the users attention. The alarm stops only when the user takes ther medicine and pressed the button.</p>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        	<p>The RTC module keeps track of the current time. A predetermined alarm time is stored in the Arduino. A series of conditional statements checks the status to control the output.If the alarm time is different from the current time and the medicine has not been taken, the red LED is on and the LCD screen reads "Good Morning!", as the alarm time is 10:30 am. If the alarm time is different from the current time and the medicine has been taken, the green LED is on and the LCD screen read "Have a nice day!"When the alarm time is the current time, the buzzer turns on and the LED strip flashes, and the LCD screen reads "Take your medicine."When the button is pressed, it says that the medicine is taken and turns off the buzzer, LED strip, and turns on the red LED. When the current time passes midnight into the next day, the time and the status of the system resets so it reads the medicine for the day has not been taken.
